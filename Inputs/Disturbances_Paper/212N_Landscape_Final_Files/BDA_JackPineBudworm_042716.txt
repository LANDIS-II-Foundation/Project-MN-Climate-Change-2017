>> Notes from discussion with Mike and Jana Albers
>>  -  0-20 year jack pine = minor host, 21-40 year jack pine =  secondary host, 41+ = primary host.
>>  -  Susceptibility class: 0-20 year jack pine should not be killed by defoliation (min age for Class 3 = 21 years)
>>  Mortality rates from Kuhlman et al. 1963 for moderate to heavy defoliation = 7.5% for 30 year, 35% for 40 year, and 43% for 60 year
>>  Assume a mean SRD BDP of 0.66 for moderate to severe defoliation.  Divide the above numbers by 0.66 to account for probability of site 
>> being affected.   

>> Anticipated behavior - jack pine longevity should be effectively limited in the western region to approximately half its >> assigned longevity by budworm disturbance.  Examine the age distributions of jack pine in east vs west (where east is defined by 
>> ecoregions above) to evaluate appropriate behavior.
